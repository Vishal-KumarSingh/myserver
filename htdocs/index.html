    <li><b>Q1. Where the file must be kept ?</b></li><br>
    <li>Ans:  The file must be kept in htdocs folder where the MyServer application is installed. <br>
    If you didn't change the path on the installation time by default iy is kept C:/MyServer/htdocs 
    Go through the location and paste your webpages inside htdocs folder . 
    
    </li><br>
    <li><b>Q2. How Can I change the port no of server ?</b></li><br>
    <li>Ans: In your application folder Open config.json in any text editor and change the port no to your 
        desired server address. We recommend you to do not change the port number but if you are running multiple servers at a same time then you should change it accordingly.. 

    </li><br>
    <li><b>Q3. What is default port of my server ?</b></li><br>
    <li>By default the port number 80 is assigned to MyServer. You can change it on config.json file</li><br>
    <li><b>Q4. Why My server is not connecting to my database?</b></li><br>
    <li>Ans: Currently MyServer doesn't support database connections and we are not working in that way.
        Sorry for inconveince but it can only execute php and deliever static files.
    Since mysql is not supported so mysqli functions can throw exceptions </li><br>
